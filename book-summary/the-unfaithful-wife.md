#### From the author

> Derek is a sexy creature and we’ve all met our own version of Derek. Powerful, charismatic and able to charm the panties of any woman he chooses. So why would his wife stay? Nina is strong, sexy and successful in her own right. Her only ‘weakness’ is the love she can’t deny for her husband.
>
> For Nina, the only way she can face and forgive each of her husband’s affairs, is to have her own safety net. One man who will always love her, and will never let her down. Having her own lover doesn’t make the pain go away, but it helps her to understand. 
> 
> In **The Unfaithful Wife**, I’ve explored the emotional cost of infidelity – both Derek and Nina. Rarely can complicated relationships last until old age. And, as my loyal readers would expect, there is a twist! Choose the lighthouse!
> 
> Cheating warning - Even though Derek doesn't cheat in The Unfaithful Wife, Nina finds solace in lovers' arms. That's the whole point of choose your own romance - taking a woman at a cross road in her life and deciding which man will be her happily ever after.
> 
> Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone.
