## Rockstars meet Reverse Harem with a touch of suspense

**Running from my past, I never expected one night with The Flying Monkeys' lead singer to find me spending lockdown with the band.**

**Sydney**
I couldn’t believe my luck.
Caught on a tour bus with The Flying Monkeys when lockdown happened.
It was only supposed to be one night with lead singer, Xavier Galis. But now there was nowhere else I wanted to be. 
Xavier might be my one, but by the end of lockdown, I doubt he’ll be my only.

**Xavier**
I've never expected much from life. The younger, forgotten half-brother to Australian rock royalty, I'm used to living from gig to gig. No woman has ever exceeded my one-night limit. Until Sydney. Until lockdown. Until I'm forced to choose between my band and the woman who’s seduced us all.

The first in the Loving the Band rockstar series, Seducing the Band in Lockdown, has one woman enjoying the love and bodies of Australian rock band, The Flying Monkeys.
Yes, there's cheating.
Yes, there's loving.
Yes, Yes, Yes. Get Seducing the Band in Lockdown, today.
