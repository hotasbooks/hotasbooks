## When the lights go down, deals are done and only the winner survives

**GG**
If anyone recognizes me, I’m dead.
If I lose my borrowed stake on the first night, I’m dead.
The rest of my life starts today, but only if I’m smarter than I was before. Never trust a man. Never fall in love.
Mask in place, I’m ready.
One last reckless gamble but this time it not my heart on the line. It’s my life.

**Scott**
Dressed to kill or be killed, GG sashayed into my game, joined my poker table and claimed my stack. I know this woman is trouble. She shouldn’t trust me with her secret. She shouldn’t trust her life to the way I play the cards.
She shouldn’t, but she does. For her sake, I cannot lose.


In the world of dubious deals and dirty money comes a sexy heroine determined to beat men at their own game, and a billionaire hero willing to catch her if she falls - whether she wants him to, or not.
With deception and desire, this contemporary romance will take you to new heights of suspense and steam.

**Reckless Gamble is a stand alone billionaire romance where lives are decided on the play of a card. No cheating and a guaranteed HEA.**

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone. 

You'll get more of Scott in the other City Sinners where his nightclubs are an exiting backdrop to romance.
