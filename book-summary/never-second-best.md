## How can Seth save his foster son when the one woman who can help, refuses to take his call?

Seth's ex-wife proved he had always been her second choice, leaving him and their children for an old love.

In the chaos of being a **single father**, and reassuring his children that they are still a family, a visit from community services threatens to **tear his foster son away**. Only the intervention of an old girlfriend and now social worker allows Seth 90 days to prove himself as a father and keep his family together.

It took years to **heal her broken heart** so how can Lucy trust what Seth feels for her is real?
After all, once upon a time she was his second choice. And in the emotion of fighting community services, **how can either of them trust their feelings are true?**

If you've ever wanted to **believe in romance** and a **second chance** at love. If you've ever deserved to be first in someone's heart. If you have a soft spot for amazing fathers who love their children. Then you'll love Never Second Best.
