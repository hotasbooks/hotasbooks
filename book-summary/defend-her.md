_This book is for Defence Brats the world over. Thank you for your sacrifice._

**Lieutenant Colonel Edison (Ed) Alexander** 

A decorated war hero shouldn't be asked to look after his commanding officer's daughter. But when Anastacia Vaughan is abducted, beaten and dumped in an ambulance bay, Ed doesn't have a choice. He can vow to defend her, but he can't vow not to fall in love. Even when that love may cost lives of those he holds dear.

**Anastacia Vaughan**

Raised as an 'Army Brat' with a father that every soldier knows, Anastacia had one rule: never date a guy in uniform. Now, her ex-husband wants money she doesn't have, and the man sworn to protect and serve refuses to see her as more than a client.

In this military suspense romance, will Ed save Anastacia before it's too late and will Anastacia finally escape from her ex-husband's circle of fear.


**Defend Her** is for every woman who loves a military hero. The romance is real, story compelling, and the steam is hot. **Get Defend Her today.**
