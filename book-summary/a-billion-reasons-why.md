## Can Ellin forgive Mason the billionaire when she fell in love with 'Ryan' the lie?

**Ellin never believed in the good of others or in love at first sight until a stranger called 'Ryan' turned up at her door.**

*This is a heartwarming novel of love, loss and the effort that 1 man makes to pay it forward*
*It grabbed My attention and focus so strong I could not put it down.*

After Mason Winters collected a billion dollars by listing his company, his world is turned upside down after being pushed aside by the new corporate owners. Needing to escape the city and women who only want his money, **Mason becomes 'Ryan'** and travels half way across the country on a whim. Never expecting to fall in love.

Ellin's **love for family** is stronger than her pride. Nervously, she introduced the world to the Australian outback with a single plea for help, never expecting to fall in love with the **stranger at her door**.

Under a billion stars she let down her defences and trusted his love. A million times he could have told her the **truth**.

Can Ellin forgive Mason his billions and remember she fell in love with the man?
