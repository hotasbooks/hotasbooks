## When the lights go down, deals are done and only the winner survives

**Ibrahim**
To get the club I had to make a deal.
To make the deal, I had to work with the devil.
I never thought the devil would demand more than I could deliver.
I'd never have put Katie at risk.
No matter what you think of me or my businesses, I'd never put money and power before the woman I love.

**Katie**
I trust Ibby with my life, but can I trust him with my heart?


In the world of nightclubs and dubious deals and dirty money comes a sexy, new hero who knows what he wants and a strong-willed heroine who is more than her looks. With deception and desire, this contemporary romance will take you to new heights of suspense and steam.

**Hard Bargain is a stand alone billionaire romance with kidnappings and bikie wars. No cheating and a guaranteed HEA.**

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone. 

You'll get more of Ibby in the other City Sinners where his nightclubs are an exiting backdrop to romance. 
Or check out rockstar romance, [Reuniting the Band in Lockdown](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FG2K96V/ "Reuniting the Band in Lockdown") when he saves the life of rockstar Xavier Galis from an angry mobster.
