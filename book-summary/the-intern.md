#### From the author

> I remember having coffee with a friend who mused that she's too culturally Indian for Australian men who will never understand her culture and traditions, but too westernised for Indian men. Can women of mixed cultures find love?
> 
> Jade is smart, gorgeous and torn between her mother's Chinese heritage and her Australian father. In The Intern, Jade must decide between the son of a Chinese diplomat and the charismatic power of her boss. One man who wants to love and cherish her, within the cultural boundaries of their shared heritage. The other lover challenges every part of her sensuality.
> 
> One of the first scenes written for this book was the confrontation scene. Fireworks! Even now when I read it back, I get goosebumps.
> 
> Cheating warning - As Jade explores who she is, she does so in the arms of her boyfriend and married lover. That's the whole point of choose your own romance - taking a woman at a cross road in her life and deciding which man will be her happily ever after.
> 
> I love Jade's strength, passion for life and belief that despite all, she deserves to find love and a happily ever after that is right for her.
