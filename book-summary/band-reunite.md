## Rockstars meet Reverse Harem with a touch of suspense

**The band is broken. My heart is shattered. Is there anything left to reunite?**
Eventually, I’m going to have to deal with the threatening texts, or keep running. Only this time, I don’t know if Xavier will find his way out of the bottle long enough to notice, or to care.**

**Sydney**
I never expected my past to find me.
I never knew how much it would hurt to lose one of my men.
Now, I'm forced to face a world where women want my men while putting the band I loves back together. Because only by reuniting do we have a chance at the future and love we deserve.

**Xavier**
Suddenly, I'm a man in demand. Respected by my legendary brother, feted by a world of women, with a rockstar lifestyle mine to take. But my band is being torn apart by our love for a woman. My woman is being torn from my life by her past and there's nothing I can do to save her. But if we don’t find a way to reunite the band, will we even have a future?
