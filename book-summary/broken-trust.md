## Can Erebus hide his past without destroying his future?

**Erebus**
Four years ago, I had it all.
Women, money, power and ego. Before one wrong move lost it all.
Forced to change my name, I used my body to pay my debts. Yes, you can judge my morals but my parents didn't deserve to lose their life savings because they trusted their son, and my body was the only asset I had to use.
Now, I've found a new town and one woman to love. But one lie is leading to another and eventually, all roads will lead to the truth.
If Felicity finds out, I'll lose the woman I never deserved.

**Felicity**
I was always the good girl. Until the mysterious Mr. E. walked into my life.
His body can command a room as quickly as his eyes can command my heart.
Only he's hiding a secret and I'm terrified of learning his truth.
After all, Erebus could have any woman. Why would he want just me?


Felicity never wanted to love a bad boy. But Erebus stole her heart from their first kiss. If you love your alpha males, you'll want to know the real Erebus and get **Broken Trust** today.

Cheating warning - Broken Trust starts with Erebus leaving after a night "working" and realizing that with his debts paid, it is time to close down this chapter of his life. 

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone. 


You'll get more of Erebus in the other City Sinners where his home becomes an sanctuary for women on the run from trouble.
