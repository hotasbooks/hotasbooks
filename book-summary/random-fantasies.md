## Darius doesn't care that the baby she is carrying isn't his

**Darius**
What use is all his money if it can't provide for the woman he loves and the baby he loves as if it's his own.
Smitten with the sexy and sassy Tara, Darius needs to track down the baby daddy and make him pay. After all, what sort of man would leave a woman to raise a child alone?
To hell with her past, Darius will shower Tara in his money and love until she forgets there was ever anyone else.

**Tara**
After all these months, why did it take until now for sexy billionaire boss, Darius Patera, to notice her as a woman?
Yes, he wants passion beyond stolen kisses and love beyond friendship.
But if Darius ever found out her secret baby daddy, Tara knows it will take hell to freeze over before he'll forgive her.

If any couple deserve a second chance at forever, it's billionaire boss Darius and his club hostess Tara.

**Random Fantasies is a stand alone secret baby billionaire romance with no cheating and a guaranteed HEA.**

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone. 

You'll get more of Darius in the other City Sinners where his home becomes an sanctuary for women on the run from trouble. Or go back to when Darius and Scott came to blows over [The Bad Kitty](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1XZM99/ "The Bad Kitty")
